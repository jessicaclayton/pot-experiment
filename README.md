# pot-experiment

Repository for data and code relating to the nutrient gradient pot experiment carried out in 2017 by Marcel Solbach. 
Aim was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of N and P fertilization and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on biomass and nutrient accumulation of crop plants, represented by barley (Hordeum vulgare).

Barley was grown in pots and were given varying concentrations of N and P in 6 increments, giving 36 different NP treatments. Barley was also grown in the presence/absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). For each treatment there were 4 replicates, this amounted to 288 pots. The height of the barley plants was measured weekly for 8 weeks. Shoots and roots of the plants were harvested and dried after 8 weeks and analysed for C and N content.
